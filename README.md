# Human-Activity-Recognition

The goal of this project is to predict the manner using the accelerometers data on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants. 

In training data “classes” is the outcome variable in the training set using predictor variables to predict 20 different test cases. 

Using the SVM to build up the model.
